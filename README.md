ðŸš€ Let's Get Started
Step 1: Get the Files
git clone https://github.com/Basquiatdid/Visualine.git

Step 2: Open in Figma Desktop
(Important: Use the desktop app, not the browser version)

Step 3: Load the Plugin
Go to Plugins â†’ Development â†’ Import plugin from manifest...

Navigate to your cloned folder

Select the manifest.json file

Step 4: Run It!
Plugins â†’ Development â†’ Visualine

The Visualine panel pops up

Select some colored shapes in your design

Click "Scan Selection"

Step 5: See the Magic âœ¨
Watch as Visualine shows you:

Which design token matches each color

Browser compatibility (widely supported? limited?)

How close the match is

Helpful usage notes

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip
The "match distance" number tells you how exact the color match is:

0 = Perfect match! ðŸŽ¯

Under 10 = Really close

Over 50 = Might want to check that color

ðŸ”® What's Next?
Visualine currently checks colors, but imagine it checking:
Typography and fonts
Spacing and layout
Border radii
Shadows and effects
